# MyCloudBook - Current Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented & Wired

1. **BLoC Provider Tree** - All BLoCs are now provided at the app level
2. **TimelineScreen** - Uses NotesBloc properly, displays notes, handles pagination
3. **SearchScreen** - Uses SearchBloc with debounced search
4. **UsageDashboardScreen** - Uses QuotaBloc to display quota information
5. **SyncStatusBanner** - Widget to show sync status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented (Needs BLoC Integration)

1. **NoteEditorScreen** - Still uses services directly, needs PagesBloc + AIBloc integration
2. **CollaborationScreen** - Uses services directly, needs CollabBloc + ChatBloc integration
3. **NoteDetailScreen** - Uses services directly, could benefit from BLoC

## üîß Critical Fixes Made

1. **NotesBloc** - Properly implemented with events/states
2. **SearchBloc** - Fully implemented with debouncing
3. **QuotaBloc** - Already implemented
4. **SyncBloc** - Already implemented
5. **App routing** - Fixed BLoC provider setup

## üöÄ Next Steps to Make Everything Work

### Immediate (Critical Path):

1. **Wire NoteEditorScreen to BLoCs**:
   - Replace direct service calls with PagesBloc events
   - Wire AI features to AIBloc
   - Handle quota checks through QuotaBloc

2. **Wire CollaborationScreen to BLoCs**:
   - Use CollabBloc for loading/managing collaborators
   - Use ChatBloc for sending/receiving messages
   - Remove direct service calls

3. **Initialize BLoCs on first use**:
   - Currently BLoCs are created but not all are initialized
   - Add initialization events in screens' initState

### Testing Required:

1. Test authentication flow end-to-end
2. Test note creation and listing
3. Test search functionality
4. Test quota display
5. Test offline sync queue

## üìù Files Changed

- `lib/app.dart` - Added MultiBlocProvider with all BLoCs
- `lib/presentation/blocs/notes/notes_bloc.dart` - Full implementation
- `lib/presentation/blocs/search/search_bloc.dart` - Full implementation  
- `lib/presentation/screens/timeline_screen.dart` - Rewritten to use NotesBloc
- `lib/presentation/screens/search_screen.dart` - Rewritten to use SearchBloc
- `lib/presentation/screens/usage_dashboard_screen.dart` - Fixed to use QuotaBloc from provider

## üêõ Known Issues

1. NoteEditorScreen still uses services directly - needs BLoC integration
2. CollaborationScreen still uses services directly - needs BLoC integration
3. Some BLoCs may not auto-initialize on first access
