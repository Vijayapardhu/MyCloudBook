## 2. Gaps & Missing Details

### 2.1 Technical Specifications

#### Missing: Database Schema Details
**Issue:** No table structures, relationships, or data models specified.
- What fields exist in the "notes" table?
- How are rough work pages linked to main notes?
- What's the collaboration permission model structure?
- Timeline storage mechanism unclear

**Recommendation:** Add database schema section with:
- Table definitions with field types and constraints
- Entity-relationship diagrams
- Indexing strategy
- Data retention policies

#### Missing: API Specifications
**Issue:** No API endpoints, request/response formats, or error codes defined.
- Supabase function signatures
- Gemini API integration points
- Realtime subscription channels
- Rate limiting policies

**Recommendation:** Add API design section with:
- REST endpoint specifications
- GraphQL schema (if using)
- Supabase Edge Functions interface
- Error response formats

#### Missing: File Storage Architecture
**Issue:** Storage structure and organization undefined.
- Image file naming conventions
- Bucket organization in Supabase Storage
- File size limits and compression strategies
- CDN delivery strategy

**Recommendation:** Define:
- Storage bucket hierarchy
- Image optimization pipelines
- File versioning approach
- Cleanup policies for deleted resources

### 2.2 Acceptance Criteria Details

#### Issue: Vague Acceptance Criteria
Section 8 lists goals but lacks measurable criteria:
- "AI generates summaries & flashcards within seconds" ‚Üí How many seconds exactly? What's the SLA?
- "High accuracy handwriting recognition" ‚Üí What accuracy percentage target?
- "Seamless offline-online sync" ‚Üí What defines "seamless"? Latency tolerance?
- "Real-time collaboration" ‚Üí Maximum collaboration delay acceptable?

**Recommendation:** Add Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART) criteria:
```
Acceptance Criteria for AI Summarization:
- Summaries generated within 5 seconds for notes up to 10 pages
- 95% user satisfaction with summary accuracy
- Automatic retry on API failures with exponential backoff
- Progress indicator shown during processing
```

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements Precision

#### Missing: Performance Benchmarks
Section 5 mentions "low latency" but provides no metrics:
- Page load time targets
- App startup time
- Offline sync throughput
- Database query performance
- API response time SLAs

**Recommendation:** Define metrics:
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for local operations
- App cold start: <2s on mid-range devices
- Image upload: <3s for 5MB images on 4G
- Offline sync queue processing: handle 100 operations/minute

#### Missing: Scalability Targets
**Issue:** "Scalable" is too abstract.
- How many concurrent users?
- Notes per user storage limit?
- Collaboration session size limits?
- Gemini API quota management?

**Recommendation:** Specify:
- Support for 10,000 concurrent users
- 100GB storage per user (configurable)
- 50 collaborators per note
- API rate limiting per user/day

### 2.4 Error Scenarios & Edge Cases

#### Issue: Minimal error handling requirements
- What happens if Gemini API is down?
- How are collaboration conflicts resolved exactly?
- What's the behavior when storage quota exceeded?
- Offline data loss scenarios?

**Recommendation:** Add error handling section:
```
Error Scenarios:
1. AI Service Unavailable
   - Display graceful error message
   - Queue processing requests
   - Show retry option
   - Cache last successful AI results

2. Collaboration Conflicts
   - Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
   - Highlight conflicting sections
   - User choose which version to keep
   - Side-by-side comparison view
```

### 2.5 Data Model Clarifications

#### Issue: Domain model ambiguity
- Note vs Notebook vs Page hierarchy unclear
- Rough work relationship to main notes not specified
- Timeline vs Folder organization model
- Task/Assignment data structure undefined

**Recommendation:** Add domain model section:
```
Entity Definitions:
- User: Account holder with profile, preferences, API keys
- Notebook: Collection of notes with metadata (name, created date, permissions)
- Note: Single document with one or more pages
- Page: Individual handwritten page (image) with AI-extracted content
- RoughWork: Linked scratchpad page(s) associated with a note
- Assignment: Task with due date, status, linked notes
```

### 2.6 Quota Management & API Monitoring

#### Issue: Quota Enforcement Mechanism Not Specified
- How are 100-page monthly limits enforced?
- Client-side only or server-side validation?
- What happens when quota exceeded?
- No database schema for tracking usage

**Recommendation:** Add quota management system:
- `user_quotas` table: track pages uploaded, storage used, tier (free/premium)
- Server-side triggers to enforce limits on insert
- `api_usage_log` table: track AI API calls, tokens used, costs
- Monthly quota reset via scheduled job
- Graceful degradation: read-only mode when quota exceeded

#### Issue: API Credit Monitoring UI Requirements
- No specification for usage dashboard
- Alert system triggers unclear
- No progress indicators for quota consumption

**Recommendation:** Add UI specifications:
- Usage dashboard with progress bars for pages (used/100), storage (used/5GB), API calls
- Alert banners at 80% and 100% quota usage
- In-app notifications for quota resets
- Settings page showing API key status and masked key
- Upgrade prompts with clear premium tier benefits

#### Issue: Tier Migration and Upgrade Flow
- No defined workflow for free ‚Üí premium upgrade
- How do users upgrade?
- What happens to existing data after upgrade?

**Recommendation:** Define upgrade flow:
- In-app purchase/subscription integration
- One-click upgrade button in settings
- Immediate quota removal after upgrade
- Clear confirmation of new limits
- Email confirmation of tier change
